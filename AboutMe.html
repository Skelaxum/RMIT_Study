<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Background:</b> Born and raised in country NSW in the small town of Corowa, I have lived in Melbourne, Brisbane and now Sydney. I am from a Croatian/Sicilian background, father was born in Croatia, my mother's parents are Croatian/Sicilian.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">My education is made up of High School year 11, self taught learning and IT courses through my current employer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I have a keen interest in personal fitness through weightlifting and powerlifting, I wanted to compete in an amateur powerlifting comp this year but the current climate of the world put a halt on that. In between work, gym and study I love to read Sci-fi, Fantasy and Philosophy books (Stoicism), currently reading Jordan Peterson's Maps of Meaning. I've just taken up miniature war gaming and painting (ASOIAF Tabletop) and currently teaching myself to play guitar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><u><b>Interests in IT</b></u></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">My interest in Computers and IT started when I helped my Uncle build my first Computer around the age of 13, the computer was an i386 which was already about 5 years old but for the time it was pretty decent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I have developed my IT skills over time with self teaching or from courses provided through my current employer. I have been working as a Systems/Network Administrator for the past 5 years and have a very good understanding of Domain Server environments, CISCO routing/switching and general IT administration/problem solving. Currently in the process of learning more about the Linux environment (Redhat, CentOS and Kali) and the capabilities that can be provided from the more open source world, currently researching and understanding containers and docking. Working in environments ranging from single person support up to a user base of over 500 users, I've had to deal with problems that I had never en-counted before but with a good logical approach you can usually find a solution and if all else fails Google is your friend.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I chose RMIT through OUO as I know RMIT have a great reputation for being leaders in the Technology education world, having RMIT on my CV will be a big help. Plus the ease of access to do online through RMIT was a big appeal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I expect to concrete my overall knowledge with more of an Industry standard that will help me further my career into the future. Currently my knowledge is broad and at times a bit disjointed, I feel it will be more consolidated at the end of my Bachelors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><u><b>Ideal Job</b></u></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50544467?type=standout#searchRequestToken=3ca1c47b-2525-4ad5-94bb-fb24ef1fefd7"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Systems Engineer &amp; Project Engineer</span></span></a></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The ideal role I will be aiming for is Systems Engineer/Project Engineer. The position is one that allows you to have the greatest input into developing, building and maintaining a software environment for any sort of business whether its a new start up or an existing multi national corporation. You are given a problem from a client and you have to come up with the solution that fits the best. The appeal of this role is the that you can be at the ground level of a whole new development or come into an existing environment and put your own personal touches on it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The skills that you require for this range from technical, logical and personal. You have to understand the software and the environment and how it operates. The technical skills could become very niche also with new technologies emerging all the time. You have to have a systems thinking and critical thinking background which comes into the logical skill, the client will have a complex problem and you will need to provide them with a simple solution and explain it to them as such. This is where the personal skills will come into play, you will need to be able to take all that technical information and translate it so that a non-technical minded person will be able to understand what you are saying. Qualifications and certificates on Windows Server, Linux, specific software will all be needed, having a Bachelors on Information Technology would put your in a more favourable position. The experience will range from project to project but having at least 5+ years of doing similar types of administration that is required for the role would be my expectation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">My current skill set is very close to what I have described above, my biggest skill I am currently lacking would be the systems thinking and critical thinking. I have only just begun my own research and education into these skills. I can also further my education with a Masters of Systems Engineering which cover my current lack of skill. My current qualifications range from Windows Server, MS Exchange/SharePoint/Azure/SCCM, CISCO, and RedHat Linux. I've spent the last 5 years in a Systems Administration role where I have been exposed to a few different software environments where I have performed level 1 to level 3 support.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">My current plan of action is to work towards getting into the Systems Engineer and Project Engineer role is learn more about the systems thinking and critical aspect side of being a Systems Engineer. I will also work towards my Bachelors of Information Technology. With my current role I have access to existing System Engineers and I will try to work under them from time to time to get an even better understanding of the day to day work of a Systems Engineer.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><u><b>Personal Profile</b></u></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><u><b>ISTJ-A &ndash; Logistician</b></u></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">A <dfn>Logistician (ISTJ)</dfn> is someone with the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted">Introverted</a>, <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant">Observant</a>, <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling">Thinking</a>, and <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting">Judging</a> personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">The Logistician personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organisations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they do &ndash; when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back none of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Logisticians don&rsquo;t make many assumptions, preferring instead to analyse their surroundings, check their facts and arrive at practical courses of action. Logistician personalities are no-nonsense, and when they&rsquo;ve made a decision, they will relay the facts necessary to achieve their goal, expecting others to grasp the situation immediately and take action. Logisticians have little tolerance for indecisiveness, but lose patience even more quickly if their chosen course is challenged with impractical theories, especially if they ignore key details &ndash; if challenges becomes time-consuming debates, Logisticians can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><u><b>Leadership Style </b></u></p>
<p style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"><strong>Meta-modern Leader</strong></p>
<p align="LEFT">You enjoy being on the innovative edge, pushing leadership and your organisation forward. Paradox and complexity invigorate you. You may be that rare person who balances pragmatism and idealism with sincerity. With a strong imagination and a willingness to take calculated risks, you enjoy envisioning a bright future. While you know that the role of a leader requires some artifice, you also understand how authenticity can deeply connect you to yourself, your work, and the people around you. Empowering others to share the role of leadership helps you co-create a better world.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-decoration: none;"><b>What do the results mean to me?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">It gives me a better understanding of my strengths that I can use and weakness that I can work on. It shows me what I sort of already understood in regards to my personality and how I operate and react in situations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-decoration: none;"><b>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">I tend to gravitate towards leadership roles when I work within a group. I also find that even when I do people tend to look towards be for some sort of leadership.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-decoration: none;"><b>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Getting a mix of personalities that can all contribute in their own way feels likes it will make for a greater variety of ideas and solutions to issues that may arise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Overall though you should never rely on a test or some sort of paperwork to tell you your strengths, weakness and who you work well with. All that will come with time and experience and trying new ways of doing things. We fail, to learn.</p>
