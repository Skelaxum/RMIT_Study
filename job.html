        <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
        <p>The ideal role I will be aiming for is the Systems Engineer/Project Engineer. The position allows you to have the most significant input into developing, building, and maintaining a software environment for any business, whether it is a new startup or an existing multinational corporation. You are given a problem from a client, and you have to come up with a solution that fits the best. This role's appeal is that you can be at the ground level of a whole new development or come into an existing environment and put your personal touches on it.</p>
        <h2>Required skills, qualifications, and experience</h2>
        <p>The skills that you need for this role range from technical, logical, and personal. You have to understand the software and the environment and how it operates. The technical skills could become very niche, also with new technologies emerging all the time. You have to have a systems thinking and critical thinking background which comes into the logical skill. The client will have a complex problem, and you will need to provide them with a simple solution and explain it to them. This is where personal skills will come into play. You will need to be able to take all that technical information and translate it so that a non-technical minded person will understand what you are saying.</p>
        <p>Qualifications and certificates on Windows Server, Linux, specific software, will all be needed; having a Bachelors on Information Technology would put you in a more favourable position.</p>
        <p>The experience will range from project to project, but having at least 5+ years of doing similar administration types would be required for my expectations.</p>
        <h2>Current skills, qualifications, and experience</h2>
        <p>My current skill set is very close to what I have described above; I have an excellent baseline in understanding how small to large environments work and what kind of software should be utilised for the client base. The biggest skill I am currently lacking would be the systems thinking and critical thinking area. I have only just begun my research and education into these skills.</p>
        <p>My current qualifications range from Windows Server, MS Exchange, SharePoint, Azure Administration, SCCM/SCOM, CISCO, and RedHat/CentOS Linux. I can also further my education with a Masters of Systems Engineering, which would cover my current lack of skill in that field.</p>
        <p>I've spent the last five years in a Systems Administration role where I have been exposed to a few different software environments where I have performed level 1 to level 3 support.</p>
        <h2>Plan of action</h2>
        <p>My current list of steps is to get into the Systems Engineer/Project Engineer role will involve learning more about the systems thinking and critical aspect of being a Systems Engineer. I will also work towards my Bachelors of Information Technology. With my current role, I have access to existing System Engineers, and I will try to work under them from time to time to better understand the day-to-day work of a Systems Engineer.</p>
