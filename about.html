        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
		<p>Name:Matthew Plazina</p>
		<p>Nickname:Plaz</p>
		<p>Student Number:S3873179</p>
		<p>Student Email:S3873179@student.mit.edu.au</p>
        <p>Background:Born and raised in country NSW in the small town of Corowa, I have lived in Melbourne, Brisbane, and now Sydney. I am from a Croatian/Sicilian background; my father was born in Croatia; my mother's parents are Croatian/Sicilian.</p>
        <p>My education comprises high school year 11, self-taught learning, and IT courses through my current employer..</p>
        <p>I have a keen interest in personal fitness through weightlifting and powerlifting, I wanted to compete in an amateur powerlifting comp this year, but the world's current climate put a halt on that.</p>
        <p>In between work, gym, and study, I love to read Sci-fi, Fantasy, and Philosophy books (Stoicism), currently reading Jordan Peterson's Maps of Meaning. I've taken up miniature wargaming and painting (ASOIAF Tabletop) and now teaching myself to play guitar. I am a big believer in self-improvement, people should always try to better themselves in all aspects of their lives; we tend to get bogged down in situations out of our control. We should always strive to be better than we were yesterday.</p>
        <h2>Interests in IT</h2>
		<p>My interest in Computers and IT started when I helped my Uncle build my first Computer around the age of 13, the Computer was an i386, which was already about five years old, but it was pretty decent for the time it was pretty decent.</p>
        <p>I have developed my IT skills over time with self-teaching and courses provided through my current employer, where I have been working as a Systems/Network Administrator for the past five years. I have an excellent understanding of Domain Server environments, CISCO routing/switching, and general IT administration/problem-solving. Currently, in the process of learning more about the Linux environment (Redhat, CentOS, and Kali) and the capabilities that can be provided from the more open source world, researching and understanding containers and docking.</p>
		<p>Working in environments ranging from single-person support to over 500 users, I've had to deal with problems that I had never en-counted before. With an excellent logical approach, you can usually find a solution else fails; Google is your friend.</p>
		<p>I chose RMIT through OUO as I know RMIT has an excellent reputation for being a leader in the Technology education world. Having RMIT on my CV will be a big help. Plus, the ease of access to do online through RMIT was a big appeal.</p>
		<p>I expect to concrete my overall knowledge with more of an Industry-standard that will help me further my career into the future. Currently, my experience is broad, and at times a bit disjointed. I feel it will be more consolidated at the end of my bachelor's.</p>
