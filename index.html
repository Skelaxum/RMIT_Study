          <li>Name: Matthew Plazina</li>
          <li>Nickname: Plaz</li>
          <li>Student Number: S3873179</li>

        <p>Background: Born and raised in country NSW in the small town of Corowa, I have lived in Melbourne, Brisbane, and now Sydney. I am from a Croatian/Sicilian background; my father was born in Croatia; my mother's parents are Croatian/Sicilian.</p>
        <p>My education comprises high school year 11, self-taught learning, and IT courses through my current employer.</p>
        <p>I have a keen interest in personal fitness through weightlifting and powerlifting, I wanted to compete in an amateur powerlifting competition this year, but the world's current climate put a halt on that. I wanted to see where my strength was with other people my age and weight. The three big lifts that powerlifting is based on are Deadlift, Squat and Benchpress. My current numbers on those lifts are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deadlift - 205kg</li>
          <li>Squat – 185kg</li>
          <li>Bench Press – 112.5kg</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In between work, gym, and study, I love to read Sci-fi, Fantasy, and Philosophy books (Stoicism), currently reading Jordan Peterson's Maps of Meaning. A few of my favourite authors include Patrick Rothfuss, George R R Martin, Joe Abercrombie and Raymond E Feist. I enjoy the worlds that those authors have created in their individual stories and their character development.</p>
        <p>I've taken up miniature wargaming and painting (ASOIAF Tabletop). I chose the Nightswatch as my first Army to paint and play as. I am a massive fan of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, and the Nightswatch were my favourite chapters, so I thought it only fitted to choose their Army. I am also teaching myself to play the guitar. My current guitar skills are very lacking at the moment, and now with these studies, I am finding hard to have a solid session, but I am still trying to get a few minutes in each day.</p>
        <p>I am a big believer in self-improvement; people should always try to better themselves in all aspects of their lives; we tend to get bogged down in situations out of our control. </p>
        <p>We should always strive to be better than we were yesterday.</p>
      <h1>Interests in IT</h1>
		  <p>My interest in Computers and IT started when I helped my Uncle build my first computer around the age of 13, the Computer was an i386, which was already about five years old, but it was pretty decent for the time it was pretty decent.</p>
      <p>I have developed my IT skills over time with self-teaching and courses provided through my current employer, where I have been working as a Systems/Network Administrator for the past five years.</p>
		  <p>I have an excellent understanding of Domain Server environments, CISCO routing/switching, and general IT administration/problem-solving. Currently, in the process of learning more about the Linux environment (Redhat, CentOS, and Kali) and the capabilities that can be provided from the more open source world, researching and understanding containers and docking.</p>
		  <p>Working in environments ranging from single-person support to over 500 users, I've had to deal with problems that I had never witnessed before. With an excellent logical approach, you can usually find a solution else; Google is your friend.</p>
      <p>During the start of the year I went down the rabbit hole of trying to understand Machine Learning and AI to some degree. I did some research into the NVIDIA Jetson Nano as we had a few of the developer kits at work. Since then I am wanting to learn more and more and get a better understand of the concepts and platforms available with Machine Learning.</p>
      <p>I chose RMIT through OUO as I know RMIT has an excellent reputation for being a leader in the Technology education world. Having RMIT on my CV will be a big help. Plus, the ease of access to do online through RMIT was a big appeal.</p>
      <p>I expect to concrete my overall knowledge with more of an Industry-standard that will help me further my career into the future. Currently, my experience is broad, and at times a bit disjointed. I feel it will be more consolidated at the end of my bachelor's.</p>
