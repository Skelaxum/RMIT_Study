        <p>A Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet wilful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose. </p>
        <p>The Logistician personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organisations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they do – when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back anone of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience. </p>
        <p>Logisticians don’t make many assumptions, preferring instead to analyse their surroundings, check their facts and arrive at practical courses of action. Logistician personalities are no-nonsense, and when they’ve made a decision, they will relay the facts necessary to achieve their goal, expecting others to grasp the situation immediately and take action. Logisticians have little tolerance for indecisiveness, but lose patience even more quickly if their chosen course is challenged with impractical theories, especially if they ignore key details – if challenges becomes time-consuming debates, Logisticians can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer. </p>

        <h2>Leadership Style</h2>
        <p>Meta-modern Leader</p>
        <p>You enjoy being on the innovative edge, pushing leadership and your organisation forward. Paradox and complexity invigorate you. You may be that rare person who balances pragmatism and idealism with sincerity. With a strong imagination and a willingness to take calculated risks, you enjoy envisioning a bright future. While you know that the role of a leader requires some artifice, you also understand how authenticity can deeply connect you to yourself, your work, and the people around you. Empowering others to share the role of leadership helps you co-create a better world.</p>
        <p>What do the results mean to me?</p>
        <p>It gives me a better understanding of my strengths that I can use and weakness that I can work on. It shows me what I already understood regarding my personality and how I operate and react in situations. I am a type person who will learn by doing and making mistakes, I like to be shown how to do something, but I will always take it on myself to learn it.</p>
        <p>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</p>
        <p>I tend to gravitate towards leadership roles when I work within a group. I also find that even when I don't put my hat in the ring for the leadership role, people tend to look towards me for some leadership. Within a group I will always try to be one of the members who will organise and structure things out, but I will also step back when the situation dictates it.</p>
        <p>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</p>
        <p>Getting a mix of personalities that can all contribute in their will make for a greater variety of ideas and solutions to issues. The many minds on one task is a great way to think of problem solving. But also, certain personalities will also conflict with each other and its being aware of those types of personalities and putting strategies in place to mitigate and issues that may arise.</p>
        <p>Overall though, you should never rely on a test or some paperwork to tell you your strengths, weakness, and whom you work well with. All that will come with time and experience and trying new ways of doing things. The only way you can truly understand how you work is by working in different environments, with different people on different problems.</p>
